Experiment 2 - Heuristic Improvement
100 rounds

P1: size 100   P2: size 100
Final win counts: {'draw': 7, 1: 47, 2: 46}

P1: size 500   P2: size 100
Final win counts: {'draw': 10, 1: 75, 2: 15}

P1: size 100   P2: size 500
Final win counts: {'draw': 5, 1: 10, 2: 85}

From the result, modified version has almost the same win rate with the vanilla version with same tree sizes. Also, we conclude that more tree sizes will have the higher chance to win the game.

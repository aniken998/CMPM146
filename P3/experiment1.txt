Experiment 1 - Tree Size

100 rounds

P1: size 100   P2: size 200
Final win counts: {'draw': 9, 1: 36, 2: 55}


P1: size 100   P2: size 300
Final win counts: {'draw': 8, 1: 12, 2: 80}


P1: size 100   P2: size 400
Final win counts: {'draw': 3, 1: 11, 2: 86}


P1: size 100   P2: size 500
Final win counts: {'draw': 2, 1: 7, 2: 91}


From the result, we conclude that the bot with larger tree size have a higher chance of winning the game.

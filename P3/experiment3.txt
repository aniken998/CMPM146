Experiment 3 â€“ Time as a Constraint
We found that the modified version won a little bit more than the vanilla when time is a constraint. 
We think the tree sizes in one second should almost be the same. Maybe the modified version is a little bit smaller,
because the result is similar to the experiment 2. We think the more complex the modified version is, the smaller tree
it will be as time elapses compared to vanilla. The more time AI spend on thinking, the higher win rate it will have.
